# fastapi_llm
Practicing fastapi llm implementation:

# Summary and Description:
This script defines a simple web application using FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ that's based on standard Python type hints. The script is structured to serve both a simple HTML-based chat interface and to handle asynchronous server-sent events (SSE) for real-time communication between the client and server. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

# Imports and Setup:
It imports necessary libraries and modules, including asyncio, FastAPI, and various response classes from fastapi and starlette.
The llm module appears to be a custom module (not standard in Python or FastAPI), likely designed to interface with a large language model (LLM), possibly for generating text based on prompts.
sse_starlette.sse is used for handling server-sent events, a standard allowing real-time communication from server to client over HTTP.
# FastAPI Application Initialization:
* An instance of FastAPI is created, initiating the web application.
# Data Model Definition:
A PromptData class is defined using Pydantic, specifying the data structure for a post request. It expects a JSON body with a "prompt" field.
# API Endpoints:
* /prompt_data POST endpoint: Accepts JSON data conforming to the PromptData model and simply returns it. This is likely a placeholder or example endpoint.
* / GET endpoint: Serves an HTML page for the chat service. The page includes a simple form for sending messages and a script to handle form submission asynchronously, posting the form data to the /completion endpoint and streaming the response back to the page.
* /completion POST endpoint: Accepts form data containing a prompt, invokes an asynchronous function to process the prompt (presumably with an LLM), and returns the response as a server-sent event stream. The function streamed_ai_response generates this streamed response by yielding chunks of data, simulating asynchronous processing.
* /stream-example GET endpoint: Demonstrates a simple usage of server-sent events by streaming a sequence of tokens back to the client, with delays introduced to mimic asynchronous processing.
# HTML and JavaScript for Chat Interface:
* The HTML served by the root endpoint provides a basic chat interface. The JavaScript code handles form submissions by sending the input message to the /completion endpoint, receiving streamed responses, and updating the webpage with these responses in real time.
# Asynchronous Stream Functions:
* streamed_ai_response: An asynchronous generator that iterates over chunks of data from the prompt_llm_async function (assumed to be an asynchronous call to a language model), yielding these chunks as server-sent events with a slight delay (await asyncio.sleep(0.5)).
The function stream_tokens inside the /stream-example endpoint demonstrates how to stream arbitrary data (a list of tokens) to a client, with variable delays between each token to simulate a real-time process.
# Conclusion:
Overall, the script demonstrates how to set up a basic chat service using FastAPI that can handle asynchronous requests and stream data in real time from the server to the client. It leverages server-sent events for real-time communication, a feature particularly useful for applications requiring live updates, such as chat applications or live data feeds.
